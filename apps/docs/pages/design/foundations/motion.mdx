## Principles

Animations can enhance the relationship between the user and the product, reducing frustrations and giving a sense of control, efficiency and direct manipulation.

This section delves into the main principles of Wanda's motion system and its two animation styles.

Below are the four essential features to keep in mind while designing any animation within the Oval's products ecosystem.

### Discreet

Motion should be valuable but subtle to avoid creating any distraction for the user. In this sense, the effectiveness of an animation is determined by its:

- **Purpose**: Is it necessary?
- **Value**: Does it help the user?
- **Efficiency**: Could it hurt the performance of the product?

In this context, choosing the right transition time can make the difference. The animation should be fast and nimble so the user would never feel stuck, waiting for the animation to end.

Draw the user's attention only when it is the purpose of the communication, like when showing an alert message.
