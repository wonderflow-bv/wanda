Although those four motion principles are always valid, it is appropriate to make a distinction between two different styles of animations:

- a functional animation designed to provide a sense of efficiency subtly
- an evocative animation whose aim is to draw attention to itself showily

Both functional and evocative approaches are essential to the experience. An optimal interface makes substantial use of fluid and subtle functional motions and rarely draws the user's attention to essential feedback using evocative animations.
