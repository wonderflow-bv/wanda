Every animation speed is defined by two crucial adjustments, the **duration** (how long the transition lasts) and the **easing** (acceleration/deceleration over time). While controlling animations and transitions between elements states, using the correct speed is essential to help users understand UI changes without complicating the task.

## Durations

During the animation, transitions should not be discordant, too fast or too slow. The right adjustments between duration and easing produce beautiful, smooth and clear transitions.

Durations should be applied based on the animation type and the distance/size of the motion. Functional transitions are significantly faster than evocative ones, and they should be defined based on the distance (traveled) or size (scaling) of the involved elements.

We provide a set of durations tokens:
