Design tokens are constant and platform-agnostic shared values. This set of data-value dictionary is used to ensure a better consistency across different platforms and digital products, plus it solve the issue of hardcoding common values inside the code over and over.

## Usage

Wanda's design tokens are generated for different platforms, this means that from a single source of truth — containing informations about colors, space, fonts, and more — we can generate platform-specific files which you can import and use.

For the web platform we provide two ways to use Wanda's design tokens, you can access them inside javascript or css by importing the relative file from the correct node_modules path.

### CSS

Then you can get the tokens by using the `token()` notation as in the following example. Note that **custom environment variables** are replaced with the final token value at build-time, so they are not dynamic like custom properties.

<Tab defaultValue="source">
  <Tab.Panel icon="layer-group" label="Source" value="source">

```css hideCopy
.MyCustomComponent {
  padding: token(--space-8);
  border-radius: token(--radius-24);
  color: hsl(token(--color-red-20) / 20%);
}
```

  </Tab.Panel>
  <Tab.Panel icon="arrow-right" label="Output" value="output">

```css hideCopy
.MyCustomComponent {
  padding: 0.44rem;
  border-radius: 1.33rem;
  color: hsl(351 77% 64% / 20%);
}
```

  </Tab.Panel>
</Tab>

As you may noticed color tokens are shipped as `hsl` colors but without the css `hsl()` notation. This is useful to handle different opacities by using the [level 4 color module syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#the-hsl-notation) like in the example above.

If you want to use the tokens in your code without using the PostCSS plugins, you can also import the css file directly and use the tokens as standard custom property:

```css
@import "@wonderflow/tokens/platforms/web/tokens.css";
```

<Snackbar kind="positive" title="About css tokens">
  If you're using the Wanda's postcss shared configuration tokens are already
  available inside CSS, you don't need to import them.
</Snackbar>

### Javascript

Design tokens are also available in JSON format, which you can import and use in your javascript code.

```jsx
import tkns from "@wonderflow/tokens/platforms/web/tokens.json";

export const Component = () => (
  <div style={{ color: `hsl(${tkns.color.blue[70]})` }} />
);
```

## Tokens list

<CodeBlock className="language-json">{JSON.stringify(tkns, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>
