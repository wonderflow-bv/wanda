      <Text as="span" size={16}>
        Yes, they are. Wonderflow extracts insights from your competitors' public data too. If a competitor's public feedback is not currently in our Feedback data lake you can request it and it will be added.
      </Text>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem value="2" summary="What is so special about your NLP analysis?">
      <Text as="span" size={16}>
        Well, it is our specialty. We have the most granular and performing ontologies for your industry, ready to be used, without any manual configuration needed on your side. On average, our VoC analysis covers 100 to 150 topics for each product category (3X more granular than any other platform) organized in a multilevel hierarchy, so that you can explore them from most generic ones to more specifics. For each topic, our artificial intelligence can determine its sentiment on a 3-level scale: positive, negative, neutral (used when a topic appears in a question, say coming from a customer support ticket).
      </Text>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem value="3" summary="Does Wonderflow integrate with other solutions?">
      <Text as="span" size={16}>
        By design, Wonderflow can integrate all pre-existing feedback solutions (like Medallia, Sprinklr, Salesforce, Bazaarvoice, etc.) that your company uses to manage customer feedback. Wonderflow can eventually setup custom integration (both in and out) using API.
