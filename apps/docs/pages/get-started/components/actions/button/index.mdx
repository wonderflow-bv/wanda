Providing buttons inside an interface is the most straightforward way to offer the user the ability to interact with the product. For this reason, users should be able to find buttons at a glance among other elements. Each button should state its action and the following result clearly, to avoid any undesired misinterpretation.

## Identifying buttons

Currently, the Wanda provides two main categories of buttons, each of them with several variants:

1. Button
2. Icon Button
2. Toggle Button
2. Split Button

In some cases, the same action can be adequately represented by more than one type of button. In other cases, however, it is advisable to use the button designed explicitly for the purpose.

Below, we propose a taxonomy, based on the visual hierarchy and relevance, the buttons should have within the same context:

## High relevance

High importance buttons represent the main actions the user can take in a particular page or screen.

Although a view may contain several actions that fall into the high importance category, it is advisable not to load the page or screen with too many primary actions. Always try to find a balance that makes the hierarchy and scale of importance of these actions clear.

### Primary buttons

Primary buttons are the more impactful call-to-action on any interface. For this reason, there should be no more than one primary button on a given view. However, be aware that not every interface requires a primary button.

In the event of an action that leads to destructive actions, like the removal or deletion of data, it is always advisable to use the primary button.

## Medium relevance

Buttons that fall into the medium importance category are more subtle than high importance ones. There may be medium importance buttons on a page either with or without high importance buttons.

### Secondary buttons

Secondary buttons are the perfect companions for primary ones. Often you have two actions beside each other but only one is the most relevant. The less relevant action can be presented then with the secondary button style or with a even less relevance style, like flat buttons.

## Low relevance

Low importance buttons are typically used in contexts where you want the user to focus on the content. An example is the "Read more..." text buttons used inside cards.

### Flat buttons

Flat buttons are the least intrusive actions you can use. They pair well with both secondary and primary actions.

There can be many flat buttons inside the view, but considering their low visual impact we suggest to limit the size of the context in which they are placed. For example a good usage of these buttons is inside well defined areas, like cards or snackabars.
