import UsageNav from "@/data/usage-nav";
import { getLayoutProps } from "@/utils/get-layout-props";

export const getStaticProps = () =>
  getLayoutProps({
    layout: "mdx",
    layoutProps: {

Themes are a set of predefined keys which should be used whenever the color should be dynamic based on the current active theme. They are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or product.
Wanda provides two themes, `light` and `dark`, both combined into a single css file.

## How to use themes

To enable themes you only need to include a single-file theme within you application.

A theme is activated by importing the `css` file inside your project. Once you include the file all the theme keys will be available as _custom properties_, eg. `var(--global-foreground)`.

```js
import "@wonderflow/react-components/themes.css";
```

This file contains both the `light` and `dark` themes which are activated based on the `data-theme` attribute:

```css
:root,
[data-theme="light"] {
  /* light theme values */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root:not([data-theme="light"]) {
    /* dark theme values */
  }
}

[data-theme="dark"],
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  /* dark theme values */
}
```

The above CSS works this way:

- **light**: activated when `data-theme` is set to `light`
- **dark**: activated when `data-theme` is set to `dark`
- **light/dark**: automatically activated based on the user's system preferences when `data-theme` is not **"light"** or **"dark"**, or when there is not the attribute at all and the `theme.css` is included.

### Advanced usage

If needed, you can also import the `json` format of the theme and use the theme keys inside javascript, however this is not recommended as you should use css strings whenever possible.

```jsx
import LightTheme from "@wonderflow/react-components/themes/light.json";

export default () => (
  <div style={{ color: LightTheme["dimmed-5"] }}>I'm dimmed</div>
  /* Use style={{ color: 'var(--dimmed-5)' }} whenever possible */
);
```

<Snackbar kind="warning" title="Keep in mind">Json themes are only meant to be used inside javascript for special use cases, you still need to import the css version to enable the theme.</Snackbar>

## Theme switching

To switch between light and dark theme you just have to add the `data-theme` attribute to the document root, or, you can add it on any element on the page, everything inside the element with the attribute will use the theme declared.

Taking this example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
Everything that is not "light" or "dark"
will use the system preferences.
The document will use the light or dark theme
based on the system preference.
-->
<html data-theme="auto">
  <body>
    <div>I'm light</div>

    <!-- Everything inside .Hero will use the dark theme -->
    <div class="Hero" data-theme="dark">I'm dark</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Providing the UI pattern to switch the theme, and handling the attribute application, is up to the consumer.
