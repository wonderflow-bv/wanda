import UsageNav from "@/data/usage-nav";
import { getLayoutProps } from "@/utils/get-layout-props";

export const getStaticProps = () =>
  getLayoutProps({
    layout: "mdx",
    layoutProps: {
      title: "Id provider",
      color: "mint",

    }
  });

Wanda's components use auto-generated IDs to handle accessibility-related attributes. While this works well for static websites (`SSG`), if you are doing server-side rendering you need to wrap your application with this provider in order to keep consistency between IDs generated on the server and the client.

```tsx lines="1,4,6"
import { IdProvider } from "@wonderflow/react-components";

export default () => (
  <IdProvider>
    <App />
  </IdProvider>
);
```
